Welcome to the documentation for the **Server-Driven UI (SDUI) Platform** — a hybrid architecture that powers multi-brand mobile applications from a single codebase.

## What is the SDUI Platform?

The SDUI Platform enables a single React Native codebase to serve **multiple branded mobile apps** (iOS and Android) whose UI layouts, content, feature flags, and A/B tests are all controlled from a central server and CMS — **without requiring app store submissions**.

<Callout type="info">
  This platform was built as a Proof of Concept demonstrating how three mobile
  brands can share over 80% of their codebase while maintaining distinct visual
  identities and feature sets.
</Callout>

## Key Capabilities

- **Server-Driven UI** — Screen layouts defined as JSON schemas with 54 component types, rendered dynamically on the client
- **Multi-Brand Support** — Four brand variants from one codebase (Premium, Youth, Value, Demo)
- **Instant Updates** — Change UI content via CMS without app store submissions
- **Dynamic Data Sources** — Server-side data resolution from external microservices (marketing, accounts) using template expressions
- **Feature Flags** — Toggle features per brand with rollout percentage control
- **A/B Testing** — Deterministic variant assignment for layout experiments
- **Personalization** — Segment-based content (prepaid, postpaid, business)
- **Overlays** — Bottom sheets and modals triggered by component actions, defined in the UI schema
- **Analytics** — Built-in event tracking for impressions, clicks, and screen views
- **OTA Updates** — Over-the-air code updates via Expo Updates

## Quick Start

<Steps>
<Step>

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Start the platform

```bash
pnpm dev:sdui
```

This sets up the database, seeds demo data, and starts all four services: the SDUI API server, CMS admin panel, marketing data source, and account data source.
