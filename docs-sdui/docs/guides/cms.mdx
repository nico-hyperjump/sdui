The CMS admin panel is a React web application that allows administrators to manage all aspects of the SDUI platform — screens, feature flags, brand themes, A/B tests, analytics, and API keys.

## Access

| Detail       | Value                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------- |
| **URL**      | http://localhost:5173/admin |
| **Email**    | `admin@telco-poc.com`       |
| **Password** | `admin123`                  |

## Dashboard

After logging in, the dashboard provides quick links to all management areas:

- **Screens** — Create and manage server-driven UI screens
- **Feature Flags** — Toggle features per brand
- **Themes** — Configure brand visual identity
- **A/B Tests** — Set up and manage layout experiments
- **Analytics** — View event summaries and recent activity
- **API Keys** — Manage mobile SDK authentication keys

## Managing Screens

Screens are the core of the SDUI system. Each screen is a JSON document describing the component tree that the mobile app renders.

### Screen Properties

| Property       | Description                                                                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Screen ID**  | Logical name (e.g., `home`, `plans`) — used by the mobile SDK to request screens                    |
| **Brand**      | Which brand this screen belongs to (`brand_a`, `brand_b`, `brand_c`)                                |
| **Segment**    | Optional user segment for personalization (`prepaid`, `postpaid`, `business`, or empty for default) |
| **Components** | JSON array describing the UI component tree                                                         |
| **Published**  | Whether the screen is live and returned by the API                                                  |
| **Version**    | Auto-incrementing version number                                                                    |

### Creating a Screen

<Steps>
<Step>

### Navigate to Screens

Click **Screens** in the sidebar navigation.

</Step>
<Step>

### Click New Screen

Click the "New Screen" button at the top of the screen list.

</Step>
<Step>

### Fill in details

- Enter a **Screen ID** (e.g., `promotions`)
- Select a **Brand** from the dropdown
- Optionally select a **Segment** for personalized variants

</Step>
<Step>

### Define components

Enter the component tree as JSON in the editor. Example:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "hero_1",
    "type": "hero_banner",
    "props": {
      "title": "Black Friday Sale",
      "subtitle": "50% off all plans",
      "image_url": "https://picsum.photos/800/400",
      "cta_text": "Shop Now",
      "cta_action": {
        "type": "navigate",
        "screen": "plans"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "offers_grid",
    "type": "action_grid",
    "props": {
      "columns": 2,
      "items": [
        { "icon": "star", "label": "Top Deals" },
        { "icon": "gift", "label": "Free Gifts" }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Save and Publish

Click **Save** to store the screen, then **Publish** to make it live. The screen will be returned by the API on the next mobile request.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Editing a Screen

1. Click on a screen in the list to open the editor
2. Modify the JSON components
3. Click **Save** — changes are saved but not live yet
4. Click **Publish** to push changes live

<Callout type="warn">
  Unpublished screens are not returned by the public API. The mobile app will
  show its cached version or a fallback until a published screen is available.
</Callout>

### Segment Variants

To show different content to different user segments:

1. Create a screen with the same **Screen ID** and **Brand** but a different **Segment**
2. For example: `home` + `brand_a` + `prepaid` shows prepaid offers
3. `home` + `brand_a` + `null` serves as the default fallback

The server automatically resolves the best match based on the user's segment.

## Managing Feature Flags

Feature flags control which features are available in each brand's app.

### Flag Properties

| Property            | Description                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Key**             | Unique identifier (e.g., `esim_support`)     |
| **Description**     | Human-readable explanation                   |
| **Brand A / B / C** | Toggle per brand (checkbox)                  |
| **Rollout %**       | Percentage of users who see the flag (0–100) |

### Toggling a Flag

1. Navigate to **Feature Flags** in the sidebar
2. Find the flag in the table
3. Toggle the brand checkboxes to enable/disable per brand
4. Adjust the rollout percentage if needed
5. Changes take effect on the next mobile config fetch

### Rollout Percentage

When set to less than 100%, the flag is enabled only for a percentage of users:

- **100%** — All users see the feature (default)
- **50%** — Approximately half of users see the feature
- **0%** — No users see the feature (regardless of brand toggles)

The assignment is deterministic — the same user always gets the same result for the same flag.

## Managing Themes

Each brand has its own visual theme that controls the mobile app's appearance.

### Theme Properties

| Section        | Fields                                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Colors**     | Primary, secondary, accent, background, text (hex values) |
| **Typography** | Font family, heading weight, body weight                  |
| **Assets**     | Logo URL, app icon URL                                    |

### Updating a Theme

1. Navigate to **Themes** in the sidebar
2. Select a brand
3. Edit the color hex values, typography settings, or asset URLs
4. Save changes

Theme changes are reflected in the mobile app on the next config fetch (typically when the app starts or the user pulls to refresh).

### Brand Themes Reference

| Brand                 | Primary            | Secondary        | Target                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Brand A (Premium)** | `#003366` (Navy)   | `#FFD700` (Gold) | Business, high-value     |
| **Brand B (Youth)**   | `#7B2CBF` (Purple) | `#00FF00` (Lime) | Young adults, data-heavy |
| **Brand C (Value)**   | `#FF6B35` (Orange) | `#4ECDC4` (Teal) | Price-conscious families |

## Managing A/B Tests

A/B tests allow you to show different screen layouts to different users and measure which performs better.

### Creating a Test

<Steps>
<Step>

### Navigate to A/B Tests

Click **A/B Tests** in the sidebar.

</Step>
<Step>

### Create New Test

Click "New Test" and fill in:

- **Name** — descriptive name (e.g., "Home Layout Test Q1")
- **Screen ID** — which screen to target (e.g., `home`)
- **Brand** — which brand to test on

</Step>
<Step>

### Define Variants

Add two or more variants with:

- **Variant name** (e.g., "Hero First", "Actions First")
- **Percentage** — traffic allocation (must sum to 100%)
- **Components** — the component tree for this variant

</Step>
<Step>

### Activate

Click **Activate** to start the test. Users will now be assigned to variants deterministically.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Test Behavior

- Users are assigned to variants using a deterministic hash of `userId + testId`
- The same user always sees the same variant
- Variant assignment is tracked as an analytics event (`ab_test_assignment`)
- Only one test can be active per screen + brand combination at a time

### Concluding a Test

1. Review analytics to compare variant performance
2. Click **Deactivate** to stop the test
3. All users will see the default screen again
4. Update the default screen with the winning variant's layout if desired

## Analytics Dashboard

The analytics page shows a summary of all tracked events.

### Available Metrics

| Metric             | Description                                                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Events**   | Overall event count                                                    |
| **Events by Type** | Breakdown by screen_view, button_click, impression, ab_test_assignment |
| **Recent Events**  | Last 100 events with timestamp, type, brand, user, and screen          |

### Using Analytics

- Monitor which screens are most viewed
- Track button click rates to measure CTA effectiveness
- Verify A/B test variant distribution (should be close to configured percentages)
- Debug issues by checking recent event logs

## Managing API Keys

API keys authenticate mobile SDK requests to the server.

### Key Properties

| Property   | Description                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Label**  | Human-readable name for the key            |
| **Brand**  | Brand scope (specific brand or all brands) |
| **Active** | Whether the key is currently valid         |

### Creating a Key

1. Navigate to **API Keys** in the sidebar
2. Click "Create Key"
3. Enter a label and select the brand scope
4. The full key is displayed **once** — copy and store it securely

<Callout type="warn">
  API keys are hashed before storage. The full key cannot be retrieved after
  creation. If lost, create a new key and update the mobile app configuration.
</Callout>

### Pre-Seeded Keys

For development, these keys are available out of the box:

| Key                     | Scope      |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| `sk_brand_a_demo_key`   | Brand A    |
| `sk_brand_b_demo_key`   | Brand B    |
| `sk_brand_c_demo_key`   | Brand C    |
| `sk_all_brands_dev_key` | All brands |
