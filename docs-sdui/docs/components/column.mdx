# Column

Container component that renders children vertically with consistent spacing between them. Column is an alias for vertical layout, similar to Stack but with different semantic meaning.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `gap` | `number` | `8` | Spacing between child components in pixels |

## Example

```json title="Screen JSON"
{
  "id": "example-1",
  "type": "column",
  "props": {
    "gap": 16
  },
  "children": [
    {
      "id": "text-1",
      "type": "text",
      "props": {
        "content": "Header",
        "variant": "heading"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "text-2",
      "type": "text",
      "props": {
        "content": "Body content"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Notes

- Column is functionally similar to Stack but provides semantic distinction
- Use Column when the vertical arrangement represents a logical column structure
- Gap applies spacing between all direct children
