# Row

Container component that renders children horizontally with consistent spacing between them. Use Row when you need to arrange components side by side.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `gap` | `number` | `8` | Spacing between child components in pixels |

## Example

```json title="Screen JSON"
{
  "id": "example-1",
  "type": "row",
  "props": {
    "gap": 12
  },
  "children": [
    {
      "id": "button-1",
      "type": "button",
      "props": {
        "label": "Cancel"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "button-2",
      "type": "button",
      "props": {
        "label": "Confirm"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Notes

- Row is the primary component for horizontal layouts
- Gap applies spacing between all direct children
- Children will wrap to the next line if they exceed the container width
