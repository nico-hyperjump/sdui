This directory contains auto-generated TypeScript/React code for the **GET** route handler (Next.js Pages Router).

## Files

### `route.ts`

Next.js Pages Router API route handler. Exports a default handler that dispatches to the correct method (GET) based on `req.method`, validates incoming requests, delegates to your `route.[method].config.ts` handler, and returns a validated JSON response via `res.json()`.

### `client.ts`

A `RouteClient` class for calling the route from **non-React** code (scripts, API utilities, server-side callers). Provides a typed method per HTTP method with automatic request/response validation via Zod.

### `use-route-get.tsx`

React hook (`useRouteGet`) for fetching data from the GET endpoint. Manages loading, error, and data states with automatic refetching support.
