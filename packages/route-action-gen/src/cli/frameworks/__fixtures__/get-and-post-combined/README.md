This directory contains auto-generated TypeScript/React code for the **GET, POST** route handlers.

## Files

### `route.ts`

Next.js App Router route handler. Exports a named handler for each HTTP method (GET, POST) that validates incoming requests, delegates to your `route.[method].config.ts` handler, and returns a validated JSON response.

### `client.ts`

A `RouteClient` class for calling the route from **non-React** code (scripts, API utilities, server-side callers). Provides a typed method per HTTP method with automatic request/response validation via Zod.

### `use-route-get.tsx`

React hook (`useRouteGet`) for fetching data from the GET endpoint. Manages loading, error, and data states with automatic refetching support.

### `use-route-post.tsx`

React hook (`useRoutePost`) for calling the POST endpoint. Manages loading and error states, supports abort controllers and timeouts.

### `server.function.ts`

A `"use server"` wrapper around the route handler. Lets you call the mutation from React Server Components or via `useServerFunction` without going through HTTP.

### `form.action.ts`

A `"use server"` form action that parses `FormData`, validates it, and calls the handler. Use with `<form action={…}>` or the `useFormAction` hook.

### `use-server-function.tsx`

React hook (`useServerFunction`) that wraps `server.function.ts` in a `useTransition`, giving you `isPending` and `execute()` for ergonomic server-function calls from client components.

### `use-form-action.tsx`

React hook (`useFormAction`) built on `useActionState`. Returns the current form state, a bound action to pass to `<form action={…}>`, and `isPending`.

### `form-components.tsx`

Pre-built React `<input>` and `<label>` component factories for every field in the request body, params, and searchParams schemas. Useful for quickly scaffolding forms with the correct `name`, `type`, and `id` attributes.
