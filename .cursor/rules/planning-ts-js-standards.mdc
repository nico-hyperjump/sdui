# Planning with TS/JS Standards

When creating a plan or todo list for a TypeScript or JavaScript project, every todo item must account for the standards in the `typescript-javascript-standards` rule.

Each planned task should include relevant steps for:

- **JSDoc comments** on every new or modified function.
- **Dependency injection** — accept collaborators as parameters with production defaults.
- **Unit tests** with 100% coverage, co-located as `.test.ts` / `.test.js` files.
- **Kebab-case file naming** for any new files.
- **Linter & TypeScript error resolution** before marking a task complete.

```
❌ BAD — missing standards steps
1. Create fetchUsers function
2. Wire it up in the component

✅ GOOD — includes standards
1. Create fetchUsers function with JSDoc, accepting db client via DI
2. Add fetchUsers.test.ts with 100% coverage using a fake db
3. Wire it up in the component with production default
4. Resolve all linter/TS errors
```
