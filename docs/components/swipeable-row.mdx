# Swipeable Row

Row component with swipe actions that reveals hidden action buttons when swiped left or right. Container displays children content with action buttons hidden behind. In production needs react-native-gesture-handler for swipe gesture detection.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `rightActions` | `array` | — | Array of action objects with `label` and `color` properties for right-side swipe actions |

## Example

```json title="Screen JSON"
{
  "id": "example-1",
  "type": "stack",
  "children": [
    {
      "id": "row-1",
      "type": "swipeable_row",
      "props": {
        "rightActions": [
          { "label": "Delete", "color": "#FF0000" },
          { "label": "Edit", "color": "#007AFF" }
        ]
      },
      "children": [
        {
          "id": "content-1",
          "type": "row",
          "children": [
            {
              "id": "text-1",
              "type": "text",
              "props": {
                "content": "Swipe left to reveal actions"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
