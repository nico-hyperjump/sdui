# Stack

Container component that renders children vertically with consistent spacing between them. Use Stack when you need to arrange components in a vertical layout.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `gap` | `number` | `8` | Spacing between child components in pixels |

## Example

```json title="Screen JSON"
{
  "id": "example-1",
  "type": "stack",
  "props": {
    "gap": 16
  },
  "children": [
    {
      "id": "text-1",
      "type": "text",
      "props": {
        "content": "First item"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "text-2",
      "type": "text",
      "props": {
        "content": "Second item"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Notes

- Stack is the primary component for vertical layouts
- Gap applies spacing between all direct children
- Use Column for similar vertical layouts with different semantic meaning
