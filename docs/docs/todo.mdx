- Search for a linter rule to enforce the rule: "A React component **must not** have any `useState` and `useEffect` statements. All the state management and effect handling should be encapsulated in custom hooks." Doc: [React](../guide/react.mdx)
- Search for a linter rule to enforce the rule: "Do not create inline functions that return JSX. Instead, create a separate component." Doc: [React](../guide/react.mdx)
- Create `route-action-gen` tool to generate the code for API routes. Doc: [API Routes](../guide/api-route.mdx)
- Create a linter rule to prevent directly reading from `process.env` in the code. Doc: [Environment Variables](../guide/env.mdx)
