In Hyperjump, we believe in the excellence of software engineering. When we performed Technical Due Diligence (TDD) for our clients, we pointed out the mistakes and gaps in their software engineering practices. After several TDD projects, we finally created a TDD framework that we use when evaluating a client's project. This framework helps streamline the process of evaluating a client's project which saves us time and resources. The TDD framework also makes it possible for anyone in the Hyperjump team to take charge of a TDD project.

On the other hand, on the other projects where we actually build the software, we don't have a framework to guide us. We have to rely on our experience and knowledge to build the software. **This often leads to inconsistencies in the software engineering practices of the team.**

That's what this Hyperjump Web Framework is for. **It is a set of tools, libraries, guidelines, and recipes that help us build well-tested, scalable, and maintainable web applications.** With this framework, we can build web applications faster, consistently, and more efficiently.
