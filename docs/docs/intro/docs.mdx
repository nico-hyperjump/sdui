title: Docs
---

This documentation website is built using [Speed Docs](https://speed-docs.dev). The pages are basically written in Markdown/MDX and compiled into static HTML pages using [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev).

To view the generated documentation website locally, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm docs:dev
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

To build the documentation website, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm docs:build
```

The built documentation website will be available in the `docs-output` directory. You can deploy it to any static site hosting service.
