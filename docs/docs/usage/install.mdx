Every new project must start using this template.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperjumptech/hyperjump-web-framework.git
```

This template is a monorepo that uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to manage the dependencies and build the project.

## Why monorepo?

A monorepo is a repository that contains multiple apps and packages. Experience has taught us that a project is never just a single app. As the project grows, it will inevitably have multiple apps aside from the main app, e.g., an admin app, scripts, etc. A monorepo allows us to manage these apps and packages in a single repository where we can share the dependencies and code between the apps and packages.
